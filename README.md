## What is the content of this repository?
This repo was born as collection of all of the exercises that I did in order to complete and pass the "Design Patterns in Swift" course by  Dmitri Nesteruk on Udemy. I approached this course to have a way of quantifying my knowledge and understanding of the Swift programming language using something which is very familiar to each developer: design patterns.
After each chapter the teacher requires the student to complete an exercise (aka the application of a design pattern) and this exercise must go through a series of unit test which are already implemented and you won't see if not consulting the solution to the exercise. A code running plugin implemented into the Udemy platform will run the code proposed against the tests.

## What are Design Patterns?
"Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).

The original book was written using C++ and Smalltalk as examples, but since then, design patterns have been adapted to every programming language imaginable: Swift, C#, Java, PHP and even programming languages that aren't strictly object-oriented, such as JavaScript.

The appeal of design patterns is immortal: we see them in libraries, some of them are intrinsic in programming languages, and you probably use them on a daily basis even if you don't realize they are there." - Dmitri Nesteruk
